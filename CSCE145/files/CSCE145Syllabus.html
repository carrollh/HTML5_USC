<H3>Description and Goals</H3>

<P>This is the first course in Computer Science and Engineering.  It
introduces the design of computer algorithms and their implementation in
the Java programming language.  The prerequisite is MATH 115 or
enrollment in MATH 141.  No prior programming experience is assumed, but
you should already have some experience using a computer.  The goals of
the course are </p>

<UL TYPE=DISK>
 <LI>Introduce computational problem-solving techniques</LI>
 <LI>Introduce the use of computers for the construction of software
 solutions</LI>
 <LI>Introduce procedural abstraction</LI>
 <LI>Introduce data abstraction and elementary concepts of
 object-oriented programming</LI>
 <LI>Introduce the development of structured, modular algorithms and
 programs</LI>
 <LI>Introduce the Java programming language.</LI>
 <LI>Introduce a modern programming development environment: Eclipse.</LI>
 <LI>Introduce a scripting language: Javascript.</LI>
 <LI>Convey some of the myriad uses for computing.</LI>

<H3>Course Structure</H3>
<UL>

<LI><P> <I>Lectures </I>present the principles of algorithmic design
and how to express your designs in the Java language. The lecture will
move along quite fast and you will need to be present in order to keep
up with all that is covered. </P></LI>

<LI><P> <I>Laboratories </I>meet to walk through an implementation of
the principles that have been presented in lecture. It's your chance to
learn how to use Eclipse for writing Java programs.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <I>Supplemental Instruction (SI) </I>is available to assist you in better understanding the course material. The SI program provides peer-facilitated study sessions led by qualified and trained undergraduate SI leaders who attend classes with you and encourage you to practice and discuss course concepts in sessions. Sessions are open to all students who want to improve their understanding of the material, as well as their grades. SI sessions will focus on the most recent material covered in class. Each SI leader holds three sessions per week to go over homework assignments, prepare for exams, and discuss programming examples. Your SI leader is <A HREF="#">TBD</A>.<br>
	Information about the time and place for supplemental instruction can be found <A HREF="http://www.sa.sc.edu/supplementalinstruction/">here</A>.  You can contact the Student Success Center at (803) 777-0684 if you have questions about SI. </P></LI>

<H2>Grading </H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>We do not accept late work in this course.  Assignments are made
available to everyone at the same time and are due at the same time.  No
credit will be given for late assignments.  Exceptions to the late
policy may be made on an emergency basis.  If there is an upcoming event
that will prevent your handing in your assignment at the assigned time,
you must email a request to your TA no less than 24 hours in advance.
Absences due to health problems are usually not exceptions unless you
are hospitalized at the time the assignment was due.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Laboratory assignments will consist of short programs to be
written in class.  Lab work is due by the end of the lab meeting time
and cannot be turned in later for credit.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Homework assignments are larger programs to be written outside of
class.  They are to be sent in <i>electronically</i> to the <A HREF="https://dropbox.cse.sc.edu">CSE Dropbox</A> or <a href="http://jblearning.turingscraft.com/codelab/jsp/jblearning/login.jsp">CodeLab </A>before the
indicated time on the day they are due, and they <b>must</b> be done
individually.</P></LI>

<LI><P>There will be two in-class tests (open book and notes) during the
semester as well as two lab tests (open book and notes).  The final exam (open book and notes) will be cumulative.
Make-up tests will be given only under extremely special
circumstances. </P></LI>
